============

Number is not a word
--------------------

When using `case-converter` you cannot use a number as separator.
In practice this means a number is always identified as a lower case letter.

![Phing targets](./images/number-problem.png "Phing targets")

As shown in the previous example, there is no way to go back to the original input string (i.e. `hello-8-world`), in _
kebab case_ this sting is written as
`hello8-world`.

Other examples (with automatic case detection):

```php
(new Convert('REEL2REAL'))->toDot(); // r.e.e.l2.r.e.a.l
(new Convert('reel2real'))->toDot(); // reel2real
(new Convert('Reel2Real'))->toDot(); // reel2.real
```

I strongly suggest to avoid numbers in strings to be converted.

Mixed conventions
-----------------

It might be evident, but _Case Converter_ cannot handle string with mixed naming conventions.

For example the string `XMLHttpRequest` will result in `x.m.l.http.request` when using _dot notation_:

```php
$xhr = new Convert('XMLHttpRequest');
$xhr->toDot() // x.m.l.http.request
```

The correct way to name this string (for Case Converter) should have been `XmlHttpRequest`.

Another example of mixed conventions:
